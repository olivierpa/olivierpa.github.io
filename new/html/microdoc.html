            Becoming a father for the first time at 31 has drastically changed Philip's mindset and priorities.

        <p>What would you do if you could see everything that's happening <b>inside your body</b> in real time? Microdoc is going to help you figure it out!
          <br><br>Taking place in a future where people get <b>chips implanted</b> so they can follow every internal changes at any moment, this project was created to see how far could a <b>bad chatbot</b> go when placed in role traditionally held by humans.

          THE PROBLEM
        </div>
        <p>We created an interface that aimed to create an <b>oppressing atmosphere</b> for the user, thanks to a never ending flow of numbers and scientific terms going through the screen and frightening alerts.
          <br><br>Our research allowed us to create <b>personas</b> that embodied the principal types of people that we really needed to take into account to design a complete experience. These personas were essential for the construction of the <b>user flow</b> that helped us identify the moments our chatbot was going to interact with the users.

          THE IDEA
        </div>
        <p>In this context, we wanted our chatbot to accentuate the <b>anxious feeling</b> users could feel after an alert by adding a different kind of layer to the experience.
          <br><br>What is a better to do that than by playing with emotions and retaining important information? That is the reason why we gave a <b>sassy personality</b> to our chatbot. It would ask questions to delay its answer, disrespect the way of life of the user and announce bad news by displaying riddles.
