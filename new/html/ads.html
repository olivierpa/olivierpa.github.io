            Bastian has been surrounded by advertisements for as long as he can remember. It's just a part of his life
            now. And it's not all bad: they can sometimes provide good advices to get reliable products.
            "It can't be that harmful to us if they're promoting it like that to the public, right?"

          FUTURE ADS?
        </div>
        <p>More than ever, moving and still images seem to follow us <b>wherever we go</b>. Advertisements are a prime example of this phenomenon as it is clear how much <b>influence</b> they still have on some people's opinion and psyche.
          <br><br>My goal was to materialize what some would call <b>nightmare scenarios</b> to see if ads could really convince us to accept the worse.

          THE PROBLEM
        </div>
        <p>In order to observe genuine reactions, both the ads and the products they displayed had to be <b>plausible</b>.
          <br>For each product, I combined technologies widely available to illustrate a future that could be <b>closer than we think</b>.
          <br><br>What would happen if the Amazon Dash Button meets smart connected clothes or when Tesla self-driving cars associate with VR headsets? What would your reaction be if you saw an ad promoting this?

          THE IDEA
        </div>
        <p>The common theme with all those new products were the <b>automation</b> of everyday and personal actions. Here are some questions these ads ask:
          <br>- Would you wear <b>Amazon clothes</b> that launch a delivery to replace them once they get a little bit shabby?
          <br>- Can you entrust your Snapchat account to a drone following you and posting pictures depending on your <b>facial expressions</b> and your body temperature?
          <br>- <b>How safe</b> would you feel wearing a VR headset inside of a self-driving car?
