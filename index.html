            <h2>ILL NATION</h2>
            <p>It all started with a <b>logo</b>.
              <br>Meant to be the emblem for a streetwear brand, the symbol was designed to act as a reminiscence of the brand's name but also to play an important part in the uniqueness of the products.
              <br><br>In order to achieve these two main goals, I borrowed a very recognizable aspect common to all team sports: <b>the jersey number</b>.
              <br><br>As a result, the letters from "<b>ill</b>" were designed to form the letter "<b>n</b>" and the number "<b>11</b>".

            <h2>the problem</h2>
            <p>Like all brands, Ill Nation needed a digital platform to sell its products.<br>The range of items being pretty narrow (different color variations of a t-shirt, a sweatshirt and a tank top), the website <b>couldn't keep the same formula</b> used by other retail competitors.
            <br><br>Ill Nation had to set itself apart by providing a <b>different shopping experience</b> and by finding a new way to <b>engage</b> its customers in the process.

            <h2>the solution</h2>
            <p>The experience revolves around the idea of Ill Nation being a <b>team</b>. When retail websites will usually welcome you with a gender choice, often illustrated with professional models, this homepage will allow you to discover the items by browsing pictures from the "<b>Ill community</b>" (posted on social media).
            <br><br>The photos are linked to the item worn and each of them being <b>available for both men and women</b>, this choice can be made on the item description page thanks to a <b>switch</b>.

            <p>We worked on a <b>complete redesign</b> of an existing tool.<br>Our tests of the previous version showed that the process was very <b>unclear to users</b> and that the whole experience felt unfinished and confusing.

            <p>We were able to <b>simplify</b> the whole process by implementing features that were more adapted to the situations the author of the inquiries usually faced when using the tool.
            <br><br>First, we allowed the user to send surveys by mail so the questions could be asked <b>remotely at any time</b>. We then made sure that the mails and surveys sent were clear enough to <b>avoid confusion</b>.
            <br><br>Last but not least, we redesigned the dashboard so the results could be evaluated on <b>one page instead of four</b>.

            <h2>PARADES</h2>
            <p>Parades is a board game initially created to be part of an exhibit curated by a <b>cancer survivor</b>.

              <br><br>Nevertheless, we managed to  find the right blend by relying on <b>true stories</b> (that ended well) and on a concept that encourage <b>cooperation but also competition</b>.

            <p>At each turn, the moderator shares with the players what happened in the patient’s life and how his condition has evolved. They can receive <b>explanations about medical terms</b> or get more details on the situation thanks to a card.
            <br><br>The goal is for them to put themselves <b>in the medical team’s shoes</b> by finding the right combination of cards (each representing a medical specialist) and to provide the right treatment as fast and accurately as possible until the patient is cured.

              <br><br>Introducing a time limit could be seen as an hurdle for the communication, but as the players focused a lot more on the cards and on the information given to them, it only inspired them to talk, work together and <b>pay more attention to the patient</b>.

              That’s a tough one…
              <br><br>I am Olivier Paruta. Born in 1995, raised in Paris, I enjoy solving problems and being creative while doing so. My strength lies in my ability to make decisions with both the user and my team in mind at all time.
              <br><br>You know what? We should talk so you can see for yourself.

              Solving problems and providing solutions is what I do best. Listening and observing users while staying creative is the way I do it.
              <br><br>I really enjoy participating in all parts of the design process: from <div class="tooltip" ontouchstart=""><b>research</b><span class="tooltiptext">SurveyMonkey<br>Loom<br>UsabilityHub<br>Maze</span></div> to initial <div class="tooltip" ontouchstart=""><b>sketches</b><span class="tooltiptext">Pen & Paper</span></div>, but also from low to high fidelity <div class="tooltip" ontouchstart=""><b>prototypes</b><span class="tooltiptext">Figma<br>Sketch<br>InVision<br>Adobe XD</span></div>, I don't discriminate.
              <br><br>My <div class="tooltip" ontouchstart=""><b>front-end coding</b><span class="tooltiptext">HTML<br>CSS<br>JavaScript<br>JQuery</span></div> skills also allow me to be the developer's best friend.

              I've been assuming the UX/UI Designer role for more than a year in two different agencies:
              <br><br>- My last experience at <div class="tooltip" ontouchstart=""><b>CREO</b><span class="tooltiptext">Sep. to Nov. 2018</span></div> in Montréal allowed me to sharpen my skills by discovering how to work for and with children. I'm glad I helped ship three games in three months on top of that.
              <br><br>- This experience completed a year at <div class="tooltip" ontouchstart=""><b>Multimédia Sorbonne</b><span class="tooltiptext">Sep. 2017 to Aug. 2018</span></div>, the agency internal to my Master's degree, where I was able to work on a daily basis alongside designers, developers and project managers on a large range of projects.
