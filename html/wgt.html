              Bringing new customers in his barbershop has never been an issue for Cedric, but he can’t say the same when it comes to building a stronger relationship and feeling of community with his regulars. Looking to gather a special group of people in a unique space in order to reward them and keep them close, Cedric for something more than what the usual social media platforms can offer him.

        <p>Small business owners, entrepreneurs and, more generally, people surrounded by a community can struggle to reach and engage directly with their most loyal followers.
          <br><br>This is where wegotribe intends to bridge the gap by giving everybody the ability to gather people and offer unique subscription plans for their services. The app allows owners to welcome their close members and make contactless transactions with them thanks to personal QR codes.

          The problem
        </div>
        <p>Centered around the creation of subscription plans, the app primarily needed this process to be as efficient and straightforward as possible.
          <br><br>In order to achieve this, we first needed to bring to light the needs of our target users: small businesses with possible recurring customers such as aestheticians, barbers, yoga teachers or even restaurants. Our research and interviews would allow us to understand better how they worked and provide a solution that would feel natural to them.

          The solution
        </div>
        <p>Our target users all had something in common: a menu containing a simple list of items customers could choose from.
          <br><br>In order for unique plans creation to be quick on wegotribe, we decided to split the process in two. The first step would be to add services, which would be as easy as making a list. Then would come the time to create plans by including any previously added services.
          <br><br>With this two-step process, they can now focus on tailoring plans for their most loyal customers and experiment with monthly fees and services included.
