        <p>That’s a tough one…
          <br><br>I am Olivier Paruta. Born in 1995, raised in Paris, I enjoy solving problems and being creative while doing so. My strength lies in my ability to make decisions with both the user and my team in mind at all time.
          <br><br>You know what? We should talk so you can see for yourself.

          What can I do?

        <p>Solving problems and providing solutions is what I do best. Listening and observing users while staying creative is the way I do it.
          <br><br>I really enjoy participating in all parts of the design process: from research to initial sketches, but also from low to high fidelity prototypes, I don't discriminate.
          <br><br>My front-end coding skills also allow me to be the developer's best friend.

          Where did I work?
        </div>
        <p>I've been caring about users for about two years now and I've helped in three different places:
          <br><br>- I'm just coming back from a few months at Lablaco to complete the redesign of the iOS app and the administrator platform. This deep dive into the fashion industry was a nice opportunity to grow my UI Design knowledge.
          <br><br>- Before this, I was in Montréal to work with CREO. It allowed me to sharpen my skills by discovering how to work for and with children. I'm glad I helped ship three games in three months on top of that. (One of them won an award!)
          <br><br>- This experience abroad completed a year at Multimédia Sorbonne in Paris, the agency internal to my Master's degree, where I was able to work on a daily basis alongside designers, developers and project managers on a large range of projects.
