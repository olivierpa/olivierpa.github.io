            Chloé has been spared by the trauma the fight against cancer can cause when it affects you
            or a member of your family, but she's really found herself drawn to this topic lately. When she found out
            an exhibit organized by a cancer survivor was being held in her city, she was eager to go to learn more
            about the artist's story.

          PARADES?

        <p>
          Parades is a board game initially created to be part of an exhibit curated by a <b>cancer survivor</b>.
            <br><br>The goal was to provide an activity to visitors that would allow them to <b>complete their experience</b> and have a better grasp of a survivor's journey.
            <br><br>Intended for a public setting, it was necessary for the game to be <b>simple and quick</b> enough so the most people could get a chance to play.

          THE PROBLEM
        </div>
        <p>
          Coming up with an <b>original concept</b> for this game was a task that provided more difficulties than expected.
            <br><br>Education and fun are often difficult to combine but adding this <b>unsettling theme</b> to the mix made things quite harder.
            <br><br>Nevertheless, we managed to  find the right blend by relying on <b>true stories</b> (that ended well) and on a concept that encourage <b>cooperation but also competition</b>.

          THE SOLUTION
        </div>
        <p>
          At each turn, the moderator shares with the players what happened in the patient’s life and how his condition has evolved. They can receive <b>explanations about medical terms</b> or get more details on the situation thanks to a card.
          <br><br>The goal is for them to put themselves <b>in the medical team’s shoes</b> by finding the right combination of cards (each representing a medical specialist) and to provide the right treatment as fast and accurately as possible until the patient is cured.

          In order to spark <b>more passionate and focused exchanges</b>, we got rid of the traditional board and introduced a time limit.
            <br><br>The only board-like element is the <b>life gauge</b> of the patient that evolves depending on their answers and on events happening in the patients’ life.
            <br><br>Introducing a time limit could be seen as an hurdle for the communication, but as the players focused a lot more on the cards and on the information given to them, it only inspired them to talk, work together and <b>pay more attention to the patient</b>.
