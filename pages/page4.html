		<h2>The Web</h2>
		<p>
			The web was originally created as an open space where freedom of expression was encouraged. When WE arrived on the scene, WE promised you that all we wanted to do was to make your journey easier.<br>
			Whether you want to find a website, see what your friends are doing or just know what others are saying, WE are here to make it as seamless as possible.<br>
			WE don't want to bother you with boring and convoluted details about how WE are able to provide you these informations.<br>
			You understand too that all of this is quite complicated to do and to explain, so you agree to don't ask to many questions.<br>
			However, like every bad guy at the end of the movie, WE feel that WE have to explain parts of our plan so you will feel like you have a chance to escape, so here it is.<br><br>
		</p>
		<h2>The Plan</h2>
		<p>
			WE make use of algorithms to selectively assume the information you would want to see, and then give you information according to this assumption. WE make these assumptions based on the information related to the user, such as former click behavior, browsing history, search history and location.<br>
			For that reason, WE are more likely to present only information that will abide by your past activity.<br>
			Our aim is to cause you to get significantly less contact with contradicting viewpoints, causing you to become intellectually isolated.<br>
			Our personalized search results and news stream are two perfect examples of this phenomenon.
