            As a senior project manager, Samuel has often struggled with the lack of understanding of its colleagues or
            stakeholders vision of the same project. This issue has lead him to endless meetings just to make sure
            everyone was on the same page as the project goes on.

        <p>Have you ever wanted to know how the different stakeholders involved in a project <b>felt about this very project?</b> Métabolisme might be the right tool for you.
          <br><br>Based on the theories developed in the Semiotics Lab of Arts and Design part of the University Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne, this tool allows a project manager to <b>visualize</b> the agreements and disagreements concerning the current state of the project and to <b>monitor</b> the evolution of the thoughts of everyone involved.

          THE PROBLEM
        </div>
        <p>We worked on a <b>complete redesign</b> of an existing tool.<br>Our tests of the previous version showed that the process was very <b>unclear to users</b> and that the whole experience felt unfinished and confusing.
          <br><br>We made the decision to create a completely <b>new user flow</b> that would contribute to a more streamlined experience. We focused on rethinking the way answers are collected and how the results are displayed.

          THE SOLUTION
        </div>
        <p>We were able to <b>simplify</b> the whole process by implementing features that were more adapted to the situations the author of the inquiries usually faced when using the tool.
          <br><br>First, we allowed the user to send surveys by mail so the questions could be asked <b>remotely at any time</b>. We then made sure that the mails and surveys sent were clear enough to <b>avoid confusion</b>.
          <br><br>Last but not least, we redesigned the dashboard so the results could be evaluated on <b>one page instead of four</b>.
